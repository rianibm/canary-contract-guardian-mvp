# Fetch.ai + ICP Integration:

This project demonstrates a collaborative integration between Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) and Fetch.ai, showcasing how to build a Bitcoin service using ICP canisters in the backend and Fetch.ai agents which can be queried via the AISI:One LLM.

## Project Structure

## Template and Codespace for Development

This project is set up as a **GitHub template** repository for easy development using **GitHub Codespaces**. To get started:

1. **Create your own repository**: Click the green **"Use this template"** button at the top of this repository page. This will create a new repository under your GitHub profile or organization with all the project files.

2. **Launch Codespace**: Once your repository is created, click the green **"Code"** dropdown button and select the **"Codespaces"** tab. Then click **"Create codespace on main"** to start a new development environment.

3. **Wait for setup**: The Codespace will automatically build and configure the development environment. This may take a few minutes as it installs all necessary dependencies and tools.

### Development Environment Configuration

The development environment is configured through two key files:

- **`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`**: Defines the Codespace configuration including the base image, extensions, and port forwarding settings
- **`scripts/devcontainer-setup.sh`**: Contains the setup script that installs dependencies like DFX (DFINITY SDK), Node.js packages, and Python requirements

You can examine these files to understand how the environment is configured or to customize it for your specific needs.

## ICP Component

The ICP component (`ic/src/backend/index.ts`) implements a dummy HTTP server with the following endpoints:

- `/get-balance` - Returns dummy balance for a Bitcoin address
- `/get-utxos` - Returns dummy UTXOs for a Bitcoin address
- `/get-current-fee-percentiles` - Returns dummy fee percentiles
- `/get-p2pkh-address` - Returns a dummy P2PKH address

Note: This is a dummy implementation that returns mock data. The actual implementation needs to be amended.

You can call from the command line:

- curl http://[canisterId].localhost:4943/
- curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{ \"address\": \"[BTC Address]\" }" http://[canisterId].localhost:4943/get-balance

---

## IC Component

To set up and run the ICP canister locally, follow these steps:

1. **Click "Use Template" and create your own repository**

2. **Open project as a VS Code Codespace**
3. **Start up a local ICP replica with BTC Node:**

   ```bash
   dfx start --clean --enable-bitcoin --bitcoin-node 127.0.0.1:18444
   ```

4. **In a separate terminal, deploy your canister:**

   ```bash
   cd ic
   dfx deploy
   ```

5. **In the browser, open and interact with HTTP Server:**
   - URL: http://{canister backend id}.localhost:4943/ (see id from deploy message)

---

## Fetch.ai Component

The Fetch.ai component (`agent.py`) implements an intelligent agent using the Chat Protocol, making it discoverable by ASI:One. The agent:

- Processes natural language queries about Bitcoin operations
- Converts user queries into appropriate API calls to the ICP canister
- Define the ICP endpoints as functions with descriptions and required parameters in the agent.
- Use a LLM to decide which endpoint needs to be called based on user query and the defined functions.
- Handles responses and presents them in a user-friendly format
- Supports various Bitcoin-related queries like checking balances, UTXOs, fees, and sending transactions

### Install uagents

```bash
pip install uagents
```

### Get Your ASI:One API Key

To use the agent, you need an ASI:One API Key. Follow these steps:

1. Go to [https://asi1.ai/](https://asi1.ai/)
2. Log in using your Google account or Fetch Wallet.
3. Navigate to **Workbench**.
4. Select **Developer** from the menu on the left.
5. Click on **Create New** to generate a new API key.
6. Copy the generated API key.
7. Open `agent.py` and set your API key in the following line:
   ```python
   ASI1_API_KEY = "YOUR_ASI1_API_KEY"  # Replace with your ASI1 key
   ```
8. Copy the cannister ID after deploying and replace the cannister ID in the `agent.py` file.

   ```bash
   Deployed canisters.
   URLs:
   Backend canister via Candid interface:
   backend: http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=umunu-kh777-77774-qaaca-cai&id=uzt4z-lp777-77774-qaabq-cai
   ```

   ```python
   CANISTER_ID = "uzt4z-lp777-77774-qaabq-cai"
   BASE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:4943"
   ```

9.

### Running the Agent

1. In a separate terminal, start the agent:

```bash
cd fetch
./venv/bin/python agent.py
```

or through npm

```bash
npm run agent
```

2. The agent will start and display its address and inspector URL:

```
INFO: [test-ICP-agent]: Starting agent with address: agent1qdla8t5m3wm7tnua69jjv3p4cr4ugmzmcj95jy9vrh4209scxs02qlxwt0g
INFO: [test-ICP-agent]: Agent inspector available at https://agentverse.ai/inspect/?uri=http%3A//127.0.0.1%3A8001&address=agent1qdla8t5m3wm7tnua69jjv3p4cr4ugmzmcj95jy9vrh4209scxs02qlxwt0g
```

3. Click on the Agent Inspector link to connect the agent with Agentverse via Mailbox

## ðŸš€ Deploying and Optimizing Your Agent

### Publishing to Agentverse

Once your agent is running successfully, you'll want to make it discoverable on the Agentverse platform. This increases its visibility and allows other users to interact with your Bitcoin service agent.

#### Step 1: Access Agentverse

1. Navigate to [https://agentverse.ai/agents](https://agentverse.ai/agents)
2. Locate your agent in the agent list (it should appear automatically if running with mailbox connection)

#### Step 2: Enhance Your Agent Profile

To maximize discoverability, update the following elements:

- **Agent Name**: Choose a descriptive name that clearly indicates its Bitcoin functionality
- **Description**: Write a compelling summary of your agent's capabilities
- **README**: Use the template provided below for a complete documentation
- **Tags**: Add relevant tags like `bitcoin`, `crypto`, `balance`, `icp`, `defi`
- **Avatar**: Upload a professional avatar or logo that represents your service

### Example Agent README Template

Here's a ready-to-use template for your agent's README on Agentverse. Simply copy and paste this entire section:
